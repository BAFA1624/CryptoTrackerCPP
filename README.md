#CryptoTrackerCPP

A simple tool to track crypto investments using public APIs for CryptoCompare.com & Coinbase. Although public, this project is more of a learning experience to get better at C++ than a serious attempt at a useful tool. I will likely reattempt it in Rust after to repeat the learning exercise.
